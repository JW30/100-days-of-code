# 100-days-of-code

Based on the [100 Days of Code Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by [Dr. Angela Yu](https://github.com/angelabauer?tab=repositories).

Currently finished 51/100 days (skipped days 1-14) ðŸ¥³.

My goal for this project is to explore new libraries and frameworks and to get some coding practice.
